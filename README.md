# LEAFLETs
 Examples to apply the leaflet package from R

Leaflet was created by Volodymyr Agafonkin a Ukranian software Engineer (https://agafonkin.com/). I have been working with the package for a while and I believe that it is the next frontier (kind of...) for visualizing spatial data in R; for three main reasons: 

1. It allows the dynamic representation of maps, meaning that you are able to zoom in/out across scales to examine particularities of any region. 
2. You have tons of providers that allow to use administrative, physical, terrain-only, etc maps which gives you flexibility to represent any spatial information 
3. The script is relatively intuitive and easy to implement, especially for dataframes with coordinates. 

In the following script you will find examples for three types of implementations: 
- A straighforward representation of maps. 
- An example of a chloropleth map depicting the different case numbers of leptospirosis in Ecuador. 
- The representation of coordinates belonging to a dichotomic category (Positive/Negative) using leaflet. 

I am still looking for a way to actually embebed the html leaflet map to my website which I believe is something that it cannot be done without subscribing to a particular site. I already have tried to do this without success (https://www.romerostories.com/post/cantones-y-su-poblaci%C3%B3n-en-ecuador). If someone has information about it please let me know. 

Finally. Many thanks to Manuel Villanueva from Peru, a veterianrian researcher that inspired me to use this package in the first place! :)
